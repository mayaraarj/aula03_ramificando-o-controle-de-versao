Bitter Sweet Symphony
The Verve
 
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down to the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah

No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)

Well, I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)
I can't change it you know, I can't change it

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die

You know I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
You’ve gotta change my mold, no, no, no

(It’s just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta can’t change my violence, melody and silence)
(I’ll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence)

(Been down)
(Ever been down)
(Can’t change my violence, melody and silence)
(Ever been down)
(Ever been down)
(Ever been down)

(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)

(Lord, yeah, babe, Lord, Lord, take me on my way
Takes me, now, yeah)
